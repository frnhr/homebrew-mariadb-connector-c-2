# homebrew-mariadb-connector-c-2
Version 2.2.2 of `mariadb-connector-c` formula which works with Python 2.7 and MySQL-Python

## Why

Seems that MariaDB 10.2.x is not compatible with `MySQL-Python` (and possibly other older Python connectors as well). See 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44239393/installing-mysqlclient-for-mariadb-on-mac-os-for-python3

## Why 2.2.2

Found this formula in `homebrew-core` repo, last one before `3.x`.

## But the URL is different

Wow, you checked :+1:

The URL in the formula gives a 404. This URL should work, and is taken from the official site: https://downloads.mariadb.com/Connectors/c/connector-c-2.2.2

Other 2.x versions might work. Or they might not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
